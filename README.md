# OxidizeMC

Enables you to write Minecraft Mods in Rust!

## NOTICE

Development has been paused because this project has basically no real purpose other than being a stupid hobby. I do fully intend to continue developing Oxidize in the future, just not right now.

## TODO

- [ ] Move Mod source to this repo
- [ ] Fix error for `lib.rs:48:15:testLogString()`
- [ ] Start using `jni-utils` crate
- [ ] Figure out how to automatically generate type-converting wrappers for Java functions
